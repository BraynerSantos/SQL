California Traffic Collision Data
This data comes from the California Highway Patrol and covers collisions from January 1st, 2001 until mid-December, 2020. 






1.)On what days are pedestrians involved in collisions?

SELECT  CASE strftime('%w', collision_date) 
       WHEN '0' THEN 'Sunday'
       WHEN '1' THEN 'Monday'
       WHEN '2' THEN 'Tuesday'
       WHEN '3' THEN 'Wednesday'
       WHEN '4' THEN 'Thursday'
       WHEN '5' THEN 'Friday'
       WHEN '6' THEN 'Saturday'
       END AS day_of_week, count(*) AS Collisions_with_pedestrians
FROM collisions
WHERE pedestrian_collision = 1
GROUP BY day_of_week
ORDER BY Collisions_with_pedestrians DESC; 



2.)Are DUIs more likely on certain days?

SELECT  CASE strftime('%w', collision_date) 
       WHEN '0' THEN 'Sunday'
       WHEN '1' THEN 'Monday'
       WHEN '2' THEN 'Tuesday'
       WHEN '3' THEN 'Wednesday'
       WHEN '4' THEN 'Thursday'
       WHEN '5' THEN 'Friday'
       WHEN '6' THEN 'Saturday'
       END AS day_of_week,  
       ((count(*)*1.0/(SELECT count(*) FROM collisions WHERE pcf_violation_category LIKE 'dui'))*100) AS Percentage_of_DUI_Collisions
FROM collisions
WHERE pcf_violation_category LIKE 'dui'
GROUP BY day_of_week
ORDER BY Percentage_of_DUI_Collisions DESC; 



3.)What are the age ad sex of driver that cause the collision?
SELECT party_age,party_sex, count(*) as amount
FROM parties AS p
WHERE at_fault = 1 AND party_age IS NOT NULL OR party_age IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY party_age
ORDER BY amount DESC;



4.) Which county in California have the highest number of collisions?
SELECT county_location, count(*) AS Number_of_collisions, population
from collisions
GROUP BY county_location
ORDER BY Number_of_collisions DESC;



5.) What type of car/motorcycle is involved in the most crashes?
SELECT Vehicle_make, count(*) AS Number_of_Vehicles
FROM parties
WHERE Vehicle_make != ' ' 
GROUP BY vehicle_make
order by Number_of_vehicles DESC
Limit 10;



6.) What type of car/motorcycle of the driver that are considered "at-fault"?
SELECT Vehicle_make, count(*) AS Number_of_Vehicles
FROM parties
WHERE Vehicle_make != ' ' AND at_fault = 1
GROUP BY vehicle_make
order by Number_of_vehicles DESC
Limit 10;
